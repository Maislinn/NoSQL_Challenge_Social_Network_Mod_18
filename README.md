## Description
AS A social media startup I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list

In this project I was able to practice my skills in MangoDB and Insomnia. I was able to practice skills to build and structure API Routes.
